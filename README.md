RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique used to evaluate and segment a company's customers based on their purchasing behavior. 

This is an online retail store project, RFM analysis involves the following steps:

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who have purchased more recently are more likely to buy again.

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase. Frequent buyers are considered more loyal and engaged.

Monetary: How much money a customer spends on purchases. High spenders are typically more valuable to the business.

By analyzing these three dimensions, the online retail store can categorize customers into various segments, such as:

Top Customers: Recent, frequent purchasers who spend a lot.

Loyal Customers: Regular purchasers with high frequency, though not necessarily recent.

Big Spenders: Customers who spend a lot but purchase less frequently.

At Risk: Customers who used to purchase frequently but haven't bought recently.
